This project was inspired by The Odin Project
The project I will be making today will be a clone of the google homepage, except it will not require a 
search engine, rather it is just a design, not an actual google search engine clone.

The things I have learnt are:
- CSS Animations
- How to design buttons, such as borders, border radius and so on
- I have also learnt in CSS how to add a certain animation/effect when hovering on things like a image, text and buttons
- I have further developed in the "class" function in HTML
